## A bit about me

- 🤖 My passion is utilising and deploying RPA (Robotic Process Automation).

- 🤯 I am diagnosed with ADHD, which I learned to use to my advantage when programming.

- 🤦‍♂️ It took me an enbarrasing amount of time to start using GitHub.

- 🤫 I have built multiple apps and websites which i'm unable to add to GitHub due to operational security.
